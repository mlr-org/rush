## Example

```{r}
library(rush)
future::plan("multisession", workers = 2)

# initialize server
config = redux::redis_config()
server = Server$new("test", config)
server$reset()

fun = function(x1, x2) {
  list(y = x1 + x2)
}

# start workers
server$start_workers(fun)
server

# check workers
server$check_workers()

# push tasks
xss = list(list(x1 = 3, x2 = 5), list(x1 = 4, x2 = 6))
server$push_tasks(xss)
Sys.sleep(1)
server$n_finished_tasks


# sync data
server$data
server$n_archived_tasks

# push more tasks
xss = list(list(x1 = 1, x2 = 5), list(x1 = 7, x2 = 6))
server$push_tasks(xss)
Sys.sleep(1)
server

# to data.table

```

## `Server`

**public**

* `$initialize(id, config)`
    - Initializes server
    - `id` is a unique identifier for the data base
    - `config` is used to connect to the server

* `$start_workers(fun, n)`
    - Starts `fun` on `n` workers
    - `fun` runs in a loop on new tasks
    - `$pull_task()` pulls task
    - `$push_result()` pushes result of `fun` to data base

* `$stop_workers()`
    - Stops worker

* `$check_workers()`
    - Checks if an error occurred on a worker
    - Returns `TRUE` if no error occurred
    - Returns error message if an error occurred

* `$push_tasks(xss, extra)` -> `keys`
    - Pushes tasks to workers
    - Adds task to task queue
    - Associates task with a key
    - `xss` -> `list(list(x1 = 3, x2 = 5), list(x1 = 4, x2 = 6))`
    - `extra` -> `list(list(timestamp, untransformed_x1, untransformed_x2), list(timestamp, untransformed_x1, untransformed_x2))`
    - Entries of `xss` and `extra` are stored with the same hash
    - Is called in the main process

* `$pop_task()` -> `list(key, xs = list(x1 = 3, x2 = 5))`
    - Pulls task from task queue
    - Is called on workers

* `$push_result(key, ys)` ->
    - Push result to data base
    - `ys` -> `list(y = 1)`
    - Is called on workers

* `$sync_data()`
    - Syncs data base with main process
    - Deserializes data base entries
    - Caches data in data.table
    - Is called in the main process

**fields**

* `$connector`
    - Returns connection to data base

* `$data`
    - Returns data.table of tasks and results

* `$terminate`
    - Returns `TRUE` if the worker should terminate

* `$queued_tasks`
    - Returns keys in task queue

* `$running_tasks`
    - Returns keys of running tasks

* `$finished_tasks`
    - Returns keys of finished tasks

* `$archived_tasks`
    - Returns keys of tasks synced to local cache

**private**

* `$.write_values(values, field, keys = NULL)`
    - Takes multiple lists (`values`), serializes them and writes them to individual redis hashes at `field`
    - If no keys are provided, new keys are generated
    - `values` -> `list(list(x1 = 3, x2 = 5), list(x1 = 4, x2 = 6))`

* `$.read_values(keys, fields)`
    - Reads multiple redis hashes at `fields` and deserializes them
    - `fields` -> `c("xs", "x_extra", "ys")`
