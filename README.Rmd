# rush

*rush* is a package designed for decentralized and distributed computing in R.
It enables workers to communicate over a shared [`Redis`](https://redis.io/) database to solve large-scale problems in parallel.
The package powers the asynchronous optimization algorithms in the [`bbotk`](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=bbotk) and [`mlr3tuning`](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=paradox) packages.

# Features

* Decentralized network architecture for robust scalability.
* Efficient communication between workers using a shared [`Redis`](https://redis.io/) database.
* Maintains low overhead, limiting delays to just a millisecond per task.
* Reduces read/write operations with a lightweight and efficient caching system.
* Offers centralized system features, such as task queues.
* Provides fast data transformation from Redis to [`data.table`](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=data.table).
* Simplifies local worker setup with [`processx`](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=processx).
* Enables scaling to large remote worker networks via the [`mirai`](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=mirai) package.
* Automatically detects and recovers from worker failures for high reliability.
* Logs worker messages directly into the Redis database using [`lgr`](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=lgr).
* Designed with minimal dependencies for lightweight integration.

## Install

Install the development version from GitHub.

```{r eval = FALSE}
remotes::install_github("mlr-org/rush")
```

And install [Redis](https://redis.io/docs/latest/operate/oss_and_stack/install/install-stack/).
