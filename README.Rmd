# rush

*rush* is a package for decentralized and distributed computing in R.
It enables efficient problem-solving across a distributed network.
The package facilitates fast and seamless data exchange between workers through a Redis database.

# Features

* Decentralized network architecture
* Small overhead of a few milliseconds per task
* Easy start of local workers with `processx` and remote workers with `mirai`.
* Designed to work with [`data.table`](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=data.table).
* Results are cached in the R session to minimize read and write operations.
* Detect and recover from worker failures.
* Store [`lgr`](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=lgr) messages of the workers in the Redis data base.
* Light on dependencies.
