# rush

Rush is a package for parallel and distributed computing in R.
It parallelizes the evaluation of R functions on a cluster of workers and provides a shared storage between the workers.
The shared storage is a [Redis](https://redis.io) data base.
Rush offers the option to define a single manager that distributes tasks to the workers.
Alternatively, the workers can create tasks themselves and communicate the results with each other via Rush.

Single manager with multiple workers strategy.

## Install

[Install Redis](https://redis.io/docs/getting-started/installation/)

## Example

```{r, include=FALSE}
future::plan("sequential")
config = redux::redis_config()
r = redux::hiredis(config)
r$FLUSHDB()
```

Initialize the rush controller instance.
The `instance_id` identifies the instance and worker in the network.
The `config` is a list of parameters for the connection to Redis.

```{r}
library(rush)
library(redux)

config = redux::redis_config()
rush = Rush$new(instance_id = "test", config)

rush
```

Next, we define a function that we want to evaluate on the workers.

```{r}
fun = function(x1, x2, ...) {
  list(y = x1 + x2)
}
```

We start two worker with the [`future`](https://future.futureverse.org/) package.

```{r}
future::plan("multisession", workers = 2)

rush$start_workers(fun = fun)
```

Now we can push tasks to the workers.

```{r}
xss = list(list(x1 = 3, x2 = 5), list(x1 = 4, x2 = 6))
keys = rush$push_tasks(xss)
rush$await_tasks(keys)
```

And retrieve the results.

```{r}
rush$fetch_finished_tasks()
```


## Task States

Tasks have four states: `queued`, `running`, `finished`, `failed`.

* `queued` tasks are in the wait list.
* `running` tasks are evaluated on a worker.
* `finished` tasks pushed their result to the data base.
* `failed` tasks threw an error.

## Worker States

Workers have four states: `running`, `terminated`, `killed`, `lost`.

* `running` workers are evaluating tasks.
* `terminated` workers are stopped.
* `killed` workers were killed by the user.
* `lost` workers crashed.
