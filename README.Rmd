# rush

*rush* is a package for parallel and distributed computing in R.
It evaluates an R expression asynchronously on a cluster of workers and provides a shared storage between the workers.
The shared storage is a [Redis](https://redis.io) data base.
Rush offers a centralized and decentralized network architecture.
The centralized network has a single controller (`Rush`) and multiple workers (`RushWorker`).
Tasks are created centrally and distributed to workers by the controller.
The decentralized network has no controller.
The workers sample tasks and communicate the results asynchronously with other workers.

# Features

* Parallelize arbitrary R expressions.
* Centralized and decentralized network architecture.
* Small overhead of a few milliseconds per task.
* Easy start of local workers with `processx`
* Start workers on any platform with a batch script.
* Designed to work with [`data.table`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/data.table/index.html).
* Results are cached in the R session to minimize read and write operations.
* Detect and recover from worker failures.
* Start heartbeats to monitor workers on remote machines.
* Snapshot the in-memory data base to disk.
* Store [`lgr`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/lgr/index.html) messages of the workers in the Redis data base.
* Light on dependencies.

## Install

Install the development version from GitHub.

```{r eval = FALSE}
remotes::install_github("mlr-org/rush")
```

And install [Redis](https://redis.io/docs/getting-started/installation/).

## Centralized Rush Network

![](man/figures/README-flow.png)

*Centralized network with a single controller and three workers.*

```{r, include=FALSE}
config = redux::redis_config()
r = redux::hiredis(config)
r$FLUSHDB()
```

The example below shows the evaluation of a simple function in a centralized network.
The `network_id` identifies the instance and workers in the network.
The `config` is a list of parameters for the connection to Redis.

```{r}
library(rush)

config = redux::redis_config()
rush = Rush$new(network_id = "test", config)

rush
```

Next, we define a function that we want to evaluate on the workers.

```{r}
fun = function(x1, x2, ...) {
  list(y = x1 + x2)
}
```

We start two workers.

```{r}
rush$start_local_workers(fun = fun, n_workers = 2)
```

Now we can push tasks to the workers.

```{r}
xss = list(list(x1 = 3, x2 = 5), list(x1 = 4, x2 = 6))
keys = rush$push_tasks(xss)
rush$wait_for_tasks(keys)
```

And retrieve the results.

```{r}
rush$fetch_finished_tasks()
```

## Decentralized Rush Network

![](man/figures/README-flow-2.png)

*Decentralized network with four workers.*
