# Scope

Parallel computing plays an important role in machine learning, especially as the size of datasets and the computational intensity of algorithms increase.
This trend necessitates the distribution of computing tasks across multiple workers.
In this context, we present `rush`, our novel framework for parallel and distributed computing in R.
`rush` enables the parallelization of arbitrary R expressions in a network of workers.
The framework implements a queue system and an efficient data store based on [Redis](https://redis.io).
It integrates the `r ref_pkg("future")` package to start workers on the local machine or remote machines.
Rush is engineered to impose minimal overhead, with the aim of a few milliseconds per task, and is optimized for both rapid and long-running tasks.
The package is designed to be lightweight and easy to use, with a simple interface and minimal dependencies.
We integrate `rush` into our optimization packages `r ref_pkg("bbotk")` and `r ref_pkg("mlr3tuning")` but still keep it as a general-purpose package.

We start the article with an overview of parallel computing in R (@sec-related-work).
Next, we show how to install Redis and the rush package.
Then we present the network architecture of the package (@sec-rush-network) and how to use the package to parallelize a simple task (@sec-example).
In this example, we present the basic functionality of the package.
Next, we present advanced features of the package (@sec-advanced-functionality).
Finally, we look at the runtime performance of the package (@sec-benchmark).

# Related Work {#sec-related-work}

As multi-core processors became commonplace in the 2000s, there was a growing need to utilize these resources effectively for computational tasks in R.
The first packages to address this need were `r ref_pkg("snow")` and `r ref_pkg("multicore")`.
With R version 2.14.0 (released in 2011), parallel computing capabilities were integrated into the base R system through the `parallel` package.
The functions `parallel::mclapply()` and `parallel::parLapply()` are parallel versions of the `lapply()` function for multicore and cluster computing, respectively.
Both functions are widely used in R packages but have some limitations.
The R session is blocked until all tasks are finished and it is not possible to retrieve partial results.
Moreover, load balancing can be an issue when the tasks have different runtimes.

The landscape further evolved with the release of the `future` package in 2016, which provided a unified and flexible parallel computing interface in R, supporting various backends such as `multisession`, `multicore`, and `callr`.
The `r ref_pkg("future.apply")` package implements parallel versions of the `*apply()` family functions, compatible with the `future` backends.

With the rise of high-performance computing (HPC) clusters, the `r ref_pkg("batchtools")` package was developed to facilitate the execution of long-running tasks on these systems.
The communication between the main process and the workers runs completely over the file system.
A notable feature of the package is the assistance in conducting large-scale computer experiments.
A more recent development in distributed computing is the `r ref_pkg("crew")` package.
The package is designed for long-running tasks in distributed systems, ranging from traditional high-performance clusters to cloud computing platforms.
A drawback of both systems is the high overhead per task.

The [rrq](https://github.com/mrc-ide/rrq) package is a task queue system for R using Redis.
It addresses the limitations of the packages by providing a non-blocking interface to parallel computing and keeping the overhead per task low.
The package allows non-interacting queues with priority levels within a queue and dependencies among tasks.
The package has an advanced error-handling mechanism, heavily influencing the heartbeat mechanism of `rush`.

`rush` aligns closely with `rrq` but differentiates itself with its integration into our optimization packages packages `botk` and `mlr3tuning`.
This includes a data structure in Redis that can be efficiently converted to a `r ref("data.table::data.table()")` and a cache mechanism that minimizes the number of read and write operations in the R session.
Moreover, the start of workers with minimal user configuration is integrated with the `r ref_pkg("processx")` package.
Looking ahead, rush allows a decentralized network architecture devoid of a central controller.
This allows the implementation of recently developed optimization algorithms such as Asynchronous Decentralized Bayesian Optimization [@Egele2023].

# Install {#sec-install}

There are several options to install Redis depending on your operating system.
You can find instructions on how to install Redis on [redis.io](https://redis.io/docs/install/install-redis/).
The `rush` package is not yet on CRAN.
You can install the development version from GitHub with `r ref_pkg("pak")`.

```{r}
#| eval: false
pak::pkg_install("mlr-org/rush")
```

`rush` is designed to be light on dependencies.
It utilizes a select few packages to establish its functionality:

* `redux` - This package is integral to rush, facilitating robust communication with the Redis server for task queuing and data storage operations.
* `processx` - Provides the core mechanism for initiating worker processes.
* `callr` - Enables rush to maintain a heartbeat process, essential for monitoring the status of remote workers.
* `parallel` - Adds L'Ecuyer-CMRG seeds to tasks, ensuring reproducibility of results.
* `checkmate` and `mlr3misc` - Used for argument validation and miscellaneous utility functions.
* `data.table` - Efficient data manipulation.
* `lgr` and `jsonlite` - Logging to the Redis database.

# Rush Network {#sec-rush-network}

The rush network is orchestrated through a combination of a controller and multiple workers (as illustrated in @fig-rush).
The controller initializes the system and starts the workers (@sec-controller).
This stage prepares the environment for task processing which includes loading the function to be evaluated and any required packages.
The controller pushes tasks to the queue and retrieves their outcomes (@sec-start-workers).
The workers pop tasks from the queue, evaluate them, and push the results to the database.
A task life cycle consists of four states: `"queued"`, `"running"`, `"finished"`, and `"failed"`.
Tasks initially enter a `"queued"` state, awaiting processing (@sec-push-task).
They remain in this state until a worker is available to handle them.
When a worker picks up a task, its status transitions to `"running"`.
This stage marks the active processing of the task.
Upon completion, a task's state is updated to `"finished"`, and its result is stored in the database (@sec-retrieve-results).
In cases where a task encounters an error or issue, its state is marked as `"failed"`.

## Example {#sec-example}

To demonstrate the core capabilities of `rush`, we present a simple, practical example utilizing the `mlr3` package for machine learning.
The example involves the assessment of a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model performance on the widely-used `spam` dataset.
We first define a function, `evaluate_svm()`, that will be dispatched to the workers for execution.
This function is designed to accept two parameters: `cost` and `gamma`.
These parameters represent the cost and the gamma hyperparameters of the SVM model, respectively.
Inside `evaluate_svm()`, the SVM model is trained on the `spam` dataset using the provided `cost` and `gamma` values.
After training the model, `evaluate_svm()` computes the classification error, which serves as the performance metric.
The function concludes by returning the classification error.
This returned value is then captured by `rush`, which manages the collection and storage of results from all the workers.
By employing `rush`, we can parallelize the evaluation of the SVM model over a grid of `cost` and `gamma` values, significantly accelerating the hyperparameter tuning process.

```{r}
library(mlr3)
library(mlr3learners)

task = tsk("spam")
splits = partition(task)
learner = lrn("classif.svm", type = "C-classification", kernel = "radial")

eval_svm = function(cost, gamma, ...) {
  learner$param_set$set_values(cost = cost, gamma = gamma)
  learner$train(task, row_ids = splits$train)
  pred = learner$predict(task, row_ids = splits$test)
  list(ce = pred$score())
}
```

## Controller {#sec-controller}

The `Rush` instance is the controller of the centralized network.
The controller starts and stops the workers, pushes tasks to the queue and fetches their results.
The controller is initialized with the function `rsh()`.
The `network_id` argument is used to identify the controller and workers belonging to the same network.
The `config` argument is a list of Redis configuration options used by the `redux` package to connect to the Redis server.

```{r}
library(rush)

config = redux::redis_config()
rush = rsh(network_id = "svm", config = config)
rush
```

Instead of passing the config to `rsh()`, we can use the `rush_plan()` function to set the config globally.
The function stores the Redis configuration options and the maximum number of workers.

```{r}
#| eval: false
config = redux::redis_config()
rush_plan(n_workers = 2, config = config)

rush = rsh(network_id = "svm")
```

Packages that use `rush` internally can access the config provided by the user to create `Rush` instances.

## Start Workers {#sec-start-workers}

Now we are ready to start the workers.
The `RushWorker` class represents a worker in the network.
The class inherits from the `Rush` controller class but adds methods to pop tasks from the queue and push results to the database.
The worker runs a loop that processes the tasks from the queue.
The default worker loop is `worker_loop_default`.
This function fetches a task from the queue, evaluates the user-defined function `fun`, pushes the results back to the database and waits for the next task.
Usually, we do not need to define a custom worker loop and pass the function `fun`.

Workers can be started on the local machine or a remote machine.
A local worker runs on the same machine as the controller.
A remote worker runs on a different machine.
We distinguish between local and remote workers because the mechanism to kill and monitor a remote worker is different.

The `$start_workers()` method starts the workers with the `processx` package.
We pass the `n_workers` argument to specify the number of workers.
If `fun` depends on global variables, we can pass them to the `globals` argument.
Our `eval_svm()` function depends on the `learner`, `task` and `splits` objects.
Packages that are needed by `fun` can be passed to the `packages` argument.

```{r}
rush$start_workers(
  fun = eval_svm,
  n_workers = 2,
  globals = c("learner", "task", "splits"),
  packages = c("mlr3", "mlr3learners", "e1071")
)

rush
```

We get more information about the workers with `$worker_info`.
The `worker_id` identifies the worker.
The `pid` is the process id of the worker process.
The `heartbeat` is the process id of the heartbeat process (see @sec-heartbeat).

```{r}
rush$worker_info
```

On a remote machine, we need to start the workers manually.
See @sec-start-script for more information on how to start workers manually.

A worker can have four states: `"running"`, `"terminated"`, `"killed"` (@sec-stop-workers) and `"lost"` (@sec-error-handling).

## Push Task {#sec-push-task}

The `$push_tasks()` method pushes tasks to the queue.
The method takes a list of tasks as input.
Each task is a list of parameters.
We push 2 tasks to the queue.

```{r}
keys = rush$push_tasks(list(
  list(cost = 1e-4, gamma = 1e-4),
  list(cost = 1e-3, gamma = 1e-3)))
```

The keys of the pushed tasks are returned.
Pushing a task takes around 0.5 milliseconds, and pushing 10,000 takes around 200 milliseconds (see @sec-benchmark).
See @sec-data-store for more information on how the tasks are stored in the Redis database.

Pushing a task is non-blocking i.e. the method returns immediately.
We can wait for a task to finish with the `$wait_for_tasks()` method.
The method blocks until all tasks are processed by the workers.

```{r}
rush$wait_for_tasks(keys)
```


## Retrieve Results {#sec-retrieve-results}

The `$fetch_finished_tasks()` method retrieves the results of finished tasks.
The method returns a `data.table` with additional meta information.
The `worker_id` of the worker that evaluated the task and the `pid` of the worker process are stored in the table.

```{r}
rush$fetch_finished_tasks()
```

There are multiple `$fetch_*()` methods available for retrieving data from the Redis database.
A matching method is defined for each task state e.g. `$fetch_queued_tasks()` and `$fetch_running_tasks()`.
Fetching the results takes around 1 millisecond for one task and 130 milliseconds for 10,000 tasks.
The method `$fetch_finished_tasks()` caches the already queried data (see @sec-caching).

We can change the included columns with the `fields` argument.
The default of `$fetch_finished_tasks()` is `c("xs", "xs_extra", "worker_extra", "ys", "ys_extra")`.
If we don't want all that extra information, we can just query `"xs"` and `"ys"`.

```{r}
rush$fetch_finished_tasks(fields = c("xs", "ys"))
```

The option`data_format = "list"` returns a `list` instead of a `data.table`.

```{r}
rush$fetch_finished_tasks(data_format = "list")
```

An advantage of the `data.table` format is that we can easily sort the results and give us access to the best result.
However, when we only need the result, a `list` has less overhead.

## Wait for Results {#sec-wait-for-results}

The `$wait_for_finished_tasks()` methods wait until a new result is available.

```{r}
rush$wait_for_finished_tasks(timeout = 1)
```

The `timeout` argument sets a timeout in seconds.

## Caching {#sec-caching}

The tasks queried with `$fetch_finished_tasks()` and `$fetch_new_tasks()` are cached.
This gives a significant speedup when we query the same data multiple times.
The cache is a `list` that is stored in the controller.
This takes around 4 milliseconds for 100 tasks, independent of the number of results in the cache (see @sec-benchmark).

```{r}
rush$fetch_finished_tasks()
```

If we change the queried fields, the change is not reflected in the cache.
In this case, we can clear the cache with the `reset_cache = TRUE` option.

## Stop Workers {#sec-stop-workers}

Local and remote workers can be terminated with the `$stop_workers(type = "terminate")` method.
The workers evaluate the currently running task and then terminate.

```{r}
rush$stop_workers(type = "terminate")
```

```{r}
#| include: false
Sys.sleep(5)
```

When we wait for a few seconds, we see that the workers are terminated.

```{r}
rush$worker_states
```

The option `type = "kill"` stops the workers immediately.
Killing a local worker is done via the `processx` package.
Remote workers are killed by pushing a kill signal to the heartbeat process.
Without a heartbeat process a remote worker cannot be killed (see @sec-heartbeat).

```{r}
rush$stop_workers(type = "kill")
```

# Advanced Functionality {#sec-advanced-functionality}

## Globals

Global are variables that are defined in the global environment but should be available on the workers.
Global variables are passed by name in the `$start_workers()` and `$create_worker_script()` methods.
The globals are serialized and stored in the redis data base.
The workers pull the globals from the data base and assign them to their global environment.

## Reproducibility {#sec-reproducibility}

Ensuring reproducibility is important in computational research.
A critical aspect of achieving this is the consistent generation of pseudo-random numbers, which underpins the replicability of tasks that involve random processes.
The Rush package addresses this need by integrating the `"L'Ecuyer-CMRG"` random number generator, as introduced by @Ecuyer2002.
This generator is designed to prevent the synchronization of random number sequences, a critical aspect in parallel computing environments.

For each task, a distinct stream of pseudo-random numbers is produced, guaranteeing consistent results independent of the number of workers.
Rush allows the specification of an initial seed during the creation of a Rush instance.
Users have the flexibility to initialize the rush controller with either a specific `"L'Ecuyer-CMRG"` seed or a standard seed.

```{r}
#| eval: false
rush = rsh(network_id = "svm", seed = 123)
```

This ensures that every task is assigned a unique stream based on the initial seed.
Furthermore, for finer control, it is possible to assign unique `"L'Ecuyer-CMRG"` seeds directly to individual tasks.

```{r}
#| eval: false
rush$push_tasks(list(list(x1 = 1, x2 = 2)), seeds = list(c(10407L, 1801422725L, -2057975723L, 1156894209L, 1595475487L, 210384600L, -1655729657L)))
```

## Error Handling {#sec-error-handling}

The `rush` package is equipped with an advanced error-handling mechanism designed to manage and mitigate errors encountered during the execution of tasks.
It adeptly handles a range of error scenarios, from standard R errors to more complex issues such as segmentation faults and network errors.

### Simple R Errors {#sec-error-handling-simple}

For errors occurring within the R environment, rush employs a strategy where such errors are caught during the task evaluation.
To illustrate, consider a scenario where we define a function intended to trigger a simple R error.
The occurring error leads to the task being labeled as `"failed"`, with the corresponding error message captured and stored in the "message" column of the data store.
This process is demonstrated in the following example.

```{r}
rush = rsh(network_id = "simple_error")

fun = function(x) {
  stop("Simple R Error")
}

rush$start_workers(fun = fun, n_workers = 2)
rush$push_tasks(list(list(x = 1)))

Sys.sleep(5)

rush$fetch_failed_tasks()
```

This approach ensures that errors do not halt the overall execution process, allowing for error inspection and task reevaluation as necessary.

### Handling Failing Workers {#sec-error-handling-workers}

The rush package also addresses scenarios where workers may fail due to crashes or lost connections, potentially causing tasks to appear as if they are in the `"running"` state indefinitely.
An example of this can be seen when simulating a segmentation fault, leading to the termination of a worker process.

If a worker crashes or the connection gets lost, it looks like a task is `"running"` forever.
As an example, we define a function that simulates a segmentation fault by killing the worker process.
The package includes the method `$detect_lost_workers()` designed to identify and manage such instances effectively.

```{r}
rush = rsh(network_id = "segmenation_fault")

fun = function(x) {
  tools::pskill(Sys.getpid())
}

rush$start_workers(fun = fun, n_workers = 2)
rush$push_tasks(list(list(x = 1)))

Sys.sleep(5)

rush$detect_lost_workers()
```

Running this method periodically adds a small overhead.
For remote workers, the package utilizes the heartbeat mechanism to check the status of the workers (see @sec-heartbeat).
Local workers are monitored using the `processx` package.
Upon identifying a lost worker, its status is updated to `"lost"`.

```{r}
rush$worker_states
```

The `$detect_lost_workers()` method allows to restart lost workers when the option `restart_workers = TRUE` is specified.
Workers that have been lost may also be restarted manually using `$restart_workers()`.
Automatically restarting workers only works for local workers.

The status of the task that caused the worker to fail is changed to `"failed"`.
See @sec-retry-tasks for more information on restarting tasks.

### Restarting Tasks {#sec-retry-tasks}

One of the resilient features of the rush package is its ability to retry tasks that have failed, thereby enhancing the robustness of task execution processes.
The `$retry_tasks()` method is central to this functionality, offering a straightforward way to reattempt the execution of tasks that did not complete successfully on their first run.
An intriguing aspect of this method is its ability to generate a new random number stream for the task being retried, if the `next_seed = TRUE` option is specified.
This ensures that the retry attempts are not merely repetitions but are executed under potentially different conditions, enhancing the chances of success.

```{r}
#| eval: false
rush$retry_task(keys)
```

Tasks can be pushed with a specific maximum number of retries.
This setting allows tasks to be attempted up to a pre-defined limit before being definitively marked as `"failed"`.
For example, setting `max_retries = 3` will ensure that a task is retried up to three additional times if initial attempts fail.

```{r}
rush$push_tasks(list(list(x = 1), list(x = 2)), max_retries = 3)
```

### Encapsulation {#sec-error-handling-encapsulation}

To bolster the resilience of the tasks, the `rush` package offers a sophisticated mechanism for function evaluation encapsulation using the `callr` package.
This approach significantly enhances the stability of workers, particularly in scenarios where executed functions may lead to severe errors such as segmentation faults.
By encapsulating function evaluations, workers are safeguarded against crashes that would otherwise tear down the entire worker.

The encapsulation is achieved by passing a specialized worker loop function to the `$start_workers()` method, which leverages the `callr` package's capabilities to execute tasks in isolated R sessions.
To illustrate, consider the scenario where we intentionally trigger a segmentation fault by terminating the process of the callr R session.

```{r}
rush = rsh(network_id = "callr")

fun = function(x) {
  tools::pskill(Sys.getpid())
}

rush$start_workers(fun = fun, n_workers = 2, worker_loop = worker_loop_callr)
rush$push_tasks(list(list(x = 1)))

Sys.sleep(5)

rush$fetch_failed_tasks()
```

Despite this aggressive action, which would typically result in a worker crash, the encapsulation provided by `callr` ensures that the worker remains operational, marking the task as `"failed"` without affecting the stability of the worker process itself.
Following this procedure, the worker's status is queried, confirming its continued operation despite the encountered error.

```{r}
rush$worker_states
```

## Timeouts {#sec-timeouts}

In the context of executing tasks within parallel computing environments, the ability to enforce execution time limits is paramount.
This ensures that no single task consumes disproportionate system resources, thereby maintaining overall system efficiency and responsiveness.
The timeout parameter of the `$push_tasks()` method allows users to set a maximum execution time for each task.

As an illustrative example, consider a scenario where a timeout of 100 milliseconds is applied to a task.
This short duration is strictly enforced, guaranteeing that if the task execution surpasses this window, it is promptly halted and marked as `"failed"`.
It is important to note that this timeout functionality is exclusively available when employing `callr` for task execution, alongside the specialized `worker_loop_callr`.
Setting a timeout comes with an overhead of around 500 milliseconds (see @sec-benchmark).

```{r}
rush = rsh(network_id = "svm")

rush$start_workers(
  fun = eval_svm,
  n_workers = 2,
  globals = c("learner", "task", "splits"),
  packages = c("mlr3", "mlr3learners", "e1071"),
  worker_loop = worker_loop_callr
)

rush$push_tasks(list(list(cost = 1e-3, gamma = 1e-2)), timeouts = 0.1)

rush$fetch_tasks()
```


## Logging {#sec-logging}

The worker logs all messages written with the `lgr` package to the database.
The `lgr_thresholds` argument of `$start_workers()` defines the logging level for each logger e.g. `c(rush = "debug")`.
Saving log messages adds a small overhead but is useful for debugging.
By default, no log messages are stored.

```{r}
rush$read_log()
```

The log level can also be changed with the `lgr_thresholds` argument of `rush_plan()`.

## Start Script {#sec-start-script}

We are not limited to start workers with the `processx` package.
A work can be started manually with a script on a remote machine.
The only requirement is that the machine has access to the Redis server and can run R scripts.

```{r}
rush$create_worker_script()
```

The `$create_worker_script()` takes also a `globals` and `packages` argument.
The globals are serialized and passed to the worker via Redis.
The packages must be installed on the remote machine but they are loaded automatically.

## Large Objects {#sec-large-objects}

The maximum size of a Redis string is 512 MiB.
If the constants of the worker loop function are larger than 512 MiB, `rush` throws an error.
If the controller and workers can access the same file system, `rush` writes the large objects to disk.
The `large_objects_path` argument of `rush_plan()` defines the directory where the large objects are stored.

::: {.callout-note}

In a future version, tasks larger than 512 MiB can be stored on disk with the same mechanism.

:::

## Queues

Rush uses a shared queue and a queue for each worker.
The shared queue is used to push tasks to the workers.
The first worker that pops a task from the shared queue evaluates the task.
Until now we only used the shared queue.
The worker queues are used to push tasks to specific workers.

```{r}
worker_id = rush$worker_ids[1]
rush$push_priority_tasks(list(list(cost = 1e-1, gamma = 1e-1)), priority = worker_id)
```

## Heartbeats {#sec-heartbeat}

The heartbeat is a mechanism to monitor the status of remote workers in distributed computing systems.
The mechanism consists of a heartbeat key with a set [expiration timeout](https://redis.io/commands/expire/) and a dedicated heartbeat process that refreshes the timeout periodically.
The heartbeat process is started with `callr` and is linked to main process of the worker.
In the event of a worker's failure, the associated heartbeat process also ceases to function, thus halting the renewal of the timeout.
The absence of the heartbeat key acts as an indicator to the controller that the worker is no longer operational.
Consequently, the controller updates the worker's status to `"lost"`.

Heartbeats are initiated upon worker startup by specifying the `heartbeat_period` and `heartbeat_expire` parameters.
The `heartbeat_period` defines the frequency at which the heartbeat process will update the timeout.
The `heartbeat_expire` sets the duration, in seconds, before the heartbeat key expires.
The expiration time should be set to a value greater than the heartbeat period to ensure that the heartbeat process has sufficient time to refresh the timeout.

```{r}
#| eval: false
rush$start_workers(
  worker_loop = fun_loop,
  n_workers = 2,
  globals = c("learner", "task", "splits"),
  packages = c("mlr3", "mlr3learners", "e1071"),
  host = "remote",
  heartbeat_period = 1,
  heartbeat_expire = 3,
  fun = eval_svm)
```

The heartbeat process is also the only way to kill a remote worker.
The `$stop_workers(type = "kill")` method pushes a kill signal to the heartbeat process.
The heartbeat process terminates the main process of the worker.

## Rush Data Store {#sec-data-store}

Tasks are stored in Redis [hashes](https://redis.io/docs/data-types/hashes/).
Hashes are collections of field-value pairs.
The key of the hash identifies the task in Redis and `rush`.

```
key : xs | ys | xs_extra
```

The field-value pairs are written by different methods, e.g. `$push_tasks()` writes `xs` and `$push_results()` writes `ys`.
The values of the fields are serialized lists or atomic values e.g. unserializing `xs` gives `list(x1 = 1, x2 = 2)`
This data structure allows quick converting of a hash into a row and joining multiple hashes into a table.

```
| key | x1 | x2 | y | timestamp |
| 1.. |  3 |  4 | 7 |  12:04:11 |
| 2.. |  1 |  4 | 5 |  12:04:12 |
| 3.. |  1 |  1 | 2 |  12:04:13 |
```
When the value of a field is a named list, the field can store the cells of multiple columns of the table.
When the value of a field is an atomic value, the field stores a single cell of a column named after the field.
The methods `$push_tasks()` and `$push_results()` write into multiple hashes.
For example, `$push_tasks(xss = list(list(x1 = 1, x2 = 2), list(x1 = 2, x2 = 2))` writes `xs` in two hashes.

::: {.callout-note}

The alternative of writing each cell in a separate field turned out to be too slow because each element has to be serialized individually.
In addition, grouping has the advantage that the worker can simply access the arguments of the function without having to store information about the search space.
The other alternative of writing each row in a string is too slow because serialization and deserialization must be performed each time the row is accessed.

:::

## Fetch Tasks {#sec-fetch-tasks}

Running the `$fetch_*` methods directly one after another could lead to tasks appearing twice because the worker could change the state of a task between the calls.
The `$fetch_tasks_with_state()` method fetches tasks with different states in one call.
The `states` parameter defines the states of the tasks that should be fetched.

```{r}
rush$fetch_tasks_with_state(states = c("queued", "running"))
```

# Benchmark {#sec-benchmark}

We benchmark the performance of `rush` with the `r ref_pkg("microbenchmark")` package with 100 repetitions.

We pushed tasks to the queue and measured the time (@fig-benchmark-push).
The number of tasks was increased from 1 to 10,000.
One task consisted of two numbers.
The runtime increased sublinearly with the number of tasks.
When pushing one task, the overhead per task was around 0.5 milliseconds.
When pushing 10,000 tasks, the overhead per task was around 0.05 milliseconds.
We use the pipeline mechanism of Redis to push multiple tasks at once which explains the sublinear increase.
It is beneficial to push multiple tasks at once.
But the overhead per task is already low for one task.
Poping a task from the queue takes around 0.5 milliseconds independent of the number of tasks in the queue.

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| label: fig-benchmark-push
#| fig-cap: Runtime Performance, measured in milliseconds, of pushing a task. Both axes are on a logarithmic scale.
tab = readRDS("bmr_push.rds")

ggplot(tab, aes(x = n, y = median)) +
  scale_x_log10() +
  scale_y_log10(expand = expansion(mult = 0.1)) +
  geom_point(
    size = 3,
    color = viridis::viridis(1, begin = 0.5),
    alpha = 0.8) +
  geom_line(color = viridis::viridis(1, begin = 0.5)) +
  geom_text(aes(label = signif(median, 2)), hjust = 1,  vjust = -1) +
  xlab("Number of Tasks") +
  ylab("Time in Milliseconds") +
  theme_minimal()
```

We fetched the results from the database and measured the time (@fig-benchmark-fetch).
This includes fetching the results from the database and converting them to a `data.table`.
The number of results was increased from 1 to 10,000.
The runtime increased sublinearly with the number of results.
When fetching one result,  the overhead per result was around 0.5 milliseconds.
When fetching 10,000 results, the overhead per result was around 0.02 milliseconds.

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| label: fig-benchmark-fetch
#| fig-cap: Runtime Performance, measured in milliseconds, of fetching the results. Both axes are on a logarithmic scale.
tab = readRDS("bmr_fetch.rds")

ggplot(tab, aes(x = n, y = median)) +
  scale_x_log10() +
  scale_y_log10(expand = expansion(mult = 0.1)) +
  geom_point(
    size = 3,
    color = viridis::viridis(1, begin = 0.5),
    alpha = 0.8) +
  geom_line(color = viridis::viridis(1, begin = 0.5)) +
  geom_text(aes(label = signif(median, 2)), hjust = 1,  vjust = -1) +
  xlab("Number of Results") +
  ylab("Time in Milliseconds") +
  theme_minimal()
```

`rush` caches already fetched results.
Fetching 100 new tasks and adding them to the cache takes around 2 milliseconds independent of the number of results in the cache.

Running the complete `woker_loop_default` function once only comes with a small overhead of around 0.8 milliseconds.
When the task evaluation is encapsulated with `callr`, the overhead is around 500 milliseconds.
