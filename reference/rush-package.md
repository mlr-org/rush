# rush: Rapid Asynchronous and Distributed Computing

Package to tackle large-scale problems asynchronously across a
distributed network. Employing a database centric model, rush enables
workers to communicate tasks and their results over a shared 'Redis'
database. Key features include low task overhead, efficient caching, and
robust error handling. The package powers the asynchronous optimization
algorithms in the 'bbotk' and 'mlr3tuning' packages.
