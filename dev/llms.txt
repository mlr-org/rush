*rush* is a package designed to solve large-scale problems
asynchronously across a distributed network. Employing a database
centric model, rush enables workers to communicate tasks and their
results over a shared [`Redis`](https://redis.io/) database. Key
features include low task overhead, efficient caching, and robust error
handling. The package powers asynchronous optimization algorithms in the
[`bbotk`](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=bbotk) and
[`mlr3tuning`](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=paradox) packages.

# Features

- Database centric model for robust scalability.
- Efficient communication between workers
  using[`Redis`](https://redis.io/).
- Maintains low overhead, limiting delays to just a millisecond per
  task.
- Reduces read/write operations with a lightweight and efficient caching
  system.
- Offers centralized system features, such as task queues.
- Provides fast data transformation from Redis to
  [`data.table`](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=data.table).
- Simplifies local worker setup with
  [`processx`](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=processx).
- Enables scaling to large remote worker networks via the
  [`mirai`](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=mirai) package.
- Automatically detects and recovers from worker failures for high
  reliability.
- Logs worker messages directly into the Redis database using
  [`lgr`](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=lgr).
- Designed with minimal dependencies for lightweight integration.

## Install

Install the latest release from CRAN.

``` r
install.packages("rush")
```

Install the development version from GitHub.

``` r
pak::pak("mlr-org/rush")
```

And install
[Redis](https://redis.io/docs/latest/operate/oss_and_stack/install/install-stack/).

## Test with Redis

To test the package, set the `RUSH_TEST_USE_REDIS` environment variable
to `true`. The test suite deletes the Redis database before execution,
so never run it against a production server.

``` r
Sys.setenv(RUSH_TEST_USE_REDIS = "true")
```
