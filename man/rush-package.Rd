\title{rush: Rapid Asynchronous and Distributed Computing}
\description{
Package to tackle large-scale problems asynchronously across a distributed network. Employing a database centric model, rush enables workers to communicate tasks and their results over a shared 'Redis' database. Key features include low task overhead, efficient caching, and robust error handling. The package powers the asynchronous optimization algorithms in the 'bbotk' and 'mlr3tuning' packages.
